## boolean operators with params

# the parentheses matter and change the outcomes of the following...
a or (b or c)
a or b or c
a or (b and c)
a or b and c

# there is a bug in the gammar definition, see: Grammar_bugs: Boolean operators
# Because of this bug we cannot differentiate between: `a or b or c` vs `a or (b or c)`
# as these end up resolving to the same representation. Once this is resolved in the ast
# pretty printer we will need to do a special trick with insering params in order to
# correctly represent the AST as code
