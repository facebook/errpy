## Developing Errpy

Unfortunately at the moment it is difficult to build Errpy because we
are still in the process of open-sourcing a dependency,
[ocamlrep](https://github.com/facebook/ocamlrep). It is possible to build,
but requires cloning `ocamlrep` and setting paths appropriately.

If you are interested in working on Errpy, please file an issue and we'll
work on the docs for this, in the meantime we are focused on getting
`ocamlrep` into the Rust repository in crates.io so that the build will be
come standard.
