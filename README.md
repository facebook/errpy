# Errpy: An Error Recovering Rust Python Parser

This is a new project to provide an error-recovering Python parser, implemented
in Rust based on tree-sitter. Our short-term goal is to use it in the [pyre
type checker](https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check), in order to provide
better IDE features.
